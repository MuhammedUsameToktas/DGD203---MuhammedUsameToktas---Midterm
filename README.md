My MidTerm Project For Game Programing 1

In this project I tryed to create an adventure RPG Text base game using ASCII.

I used Chat gpt to create an optimized story node structer and organize the story.

The ASCII Arts dosent belong to me. I made changes on them but I taked them from https://ascii.co.uk/art for this project.
