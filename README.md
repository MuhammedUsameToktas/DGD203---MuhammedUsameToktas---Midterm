My MidTerm Project For Game Programing 1

In this project I tryed to create an adventure RPG Text base game using ASCII.

I used Chat gpt to create an optimized story node structer and organize the story.

The ASCII Arts dosent belong to me. I made changes on them but I taked them from https://ascii.co.uk/art for this project.

     .'. \_()_/       
      |   | . \
      |.  | .  \
     .'. ,\_____'.    


I want to create the old retro text based adventure game feel with this project.

The project isn't finished yet. There are some mistakes I have to fix and changes I need to add.

I hope you have enjoid it while playing it.  :)
